# Common TypeScript Techniques

Welcome to the Common Techniques section. This section covers fundamental techniques and patterns that are useful across various TypeScript challenges and everyday TypeScript development.

## Available Techniques

- [Type Equality](./type-equality.md) - How to check if two types are equal
- [Recursive Depth](./recursive-depth.md) - Understanding and managing recursive type depth
- [Arrow Function Overload](./arrow-function-overload.md) - How to create overloaded arrow functions

## Why These Techniques Matter

Understanding these common techniques will help you:

1. **Write more robust code** - By leveraging the type system effectively
2. **Debug type issues** - By knowing how TypeScript evaluates complex types
3. **Create reusable type utilities** - That can be applied across your codebase
4. **Recognize patterns** - In how types can be manipulated and combined

These techniques are often building blocks for solving more complex type challenges.
