# Hard Challenges

Welcome to the Hard Challenges section. These challenges represent the most complex TypeScript type puzzles and will push your understanding of the type system to its limits.

## Available Challenges

- [SimpleVue](./simplevue.md) - Implement a simplified version of Vue.js typing system
- [Union to Intersection](./union-to-intersection.md) - Convert union types to intersection types
- [IsAny](./is-any.md) - Create a type that checks if a type is the `any` type

## What to Expect

Hard challenges involve advanced type system concepts including:

- Complex recursive types
- Leveraging edge cases in the type system
- Advanced type inference techniques
- Type-level algorithms
- Deep understanding of how the TypeScript compiler processes types

These challenges often require thinking about types in non-intuitive ways. Don't be discouraged if they seem difficult at first - they're designed to stretch your understanding of what's possible with TypeScript's type system.

Choose any challenge from the list above to get started!
